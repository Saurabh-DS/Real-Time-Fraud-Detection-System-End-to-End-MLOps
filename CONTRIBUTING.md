# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes**. Ensure your code follows the project's style (PEP 8 for Python).
3.  **Test your changes**. Run any relevant tests or scripts.
4.  **Issue a Pull Request**. Describe your changes clearly.

## Code Style

-   **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use `logging` instead of `print` for output.
-   **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in `docs/` if your changes affect architecture or usage.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue describing the problem and how to reproduce it.

Thank you for contributing!
